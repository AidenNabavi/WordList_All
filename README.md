Description:

Wordlists are essential tools for hackers engaging in brute force attacks, enabling them to automatically and rapidly attempt all possible combinations of passwords and access keys. These tools utilize lists of common words, default passwords, or even random combinations of letters and numbers to exploit weaknesses in systems and grant unauthorized access. Due to negligence and insufficient attention to security measures, this method sometimes becomes a major threat to organizations and online systems.
